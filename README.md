## Instructions to Run

### Backend:
To run the backend application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run the following command to start the backend server:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 dhairyarora0208/recommender-backend
    ```

### Frontend:
To run the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Execute the following command to launch the frontend server:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 dhairyarora0208/recommender-frontend
    ```

Once both backend and frontend servers are running, you can interact with the application by accessing `localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Project Components
